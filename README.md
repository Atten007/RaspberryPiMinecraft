<h2>OpenJDK Warnings for 1.17</h2>
The server is now displaying a warning that OpenJDK versions older than OpenJDK 16 will stop working next update.  Unfortunately Raspberry Pi OS only has OpenJDK 11 as the latest one available in the repository for the official 32 bit release.<br>
<br>
Fortunately I have a guide to update your OpenJDK version using a sneaky trick with snapd to give you a newer version than is available in the repositories available here: <a href="https://jamesachambers.com/upgrade-java-past-apts-openjdk-11-on-raspberry-pi-os/">https://jamesachambers.com/upgrade-java-past-apts-openjdk-11-on-raspberry-pi-os/</a>.  This will be implemented into the script in some fashion for the 1.17 release since it seems unlikely that the Pi repositories are going to jump 5 versions in the next few days / weeks but for those of you who want to take care of it right away you can get the new OpenJDK up and running right now.<br>

<h2>Changing Minecraft Server Versions</h2>
If a new version of Minecraft is out and the script hasn't been updated yet you can change it in the SetupMinecraft.sh script.  If you use the command nano SetupMinecraft.sh it will be the first line in the file like this:<br>
<br>
Version="1.17.1"<br>
AllowLocalCopy="1"<br>
<br>
Make sure to change AllowLocalCopy="1" to tell the script you want to actually run the local copy instead of the latest version.<br>
Note that for this to work the Paper Minecraft server must also have released the latest version or the download will fail.  You can check here: <a href="https://papermc.io/downloads">https://papermc.io/downloads</a><br>

<h2>Check Java Version</h2>

<p>Sometimes if you have multiple versions of Java installed the wrong version of Java will be selected as the default.  If the server didn't start check that the right version of Java is selected with this command:</p>
<p>If you get the message "<em>update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for java</em>" then you only have one version of Java installed and can skip to the next section.</p>
<p>If you are presented with a list of choices then your machine has multiple versions of Java installed.  It will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>update-alternatives: warning: /etc/alternatives/java has been changed (manually or by a script); switching to manual updates only
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
  0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode
</code></pre>
<p>You will usually want to just select the newest version of OpenJDK that is listed so you would type 0 and press enter.  In some cases on some platforms you may want to switch to the official Oracle JDK although I strongly recommend sticking with OpenJDK!</p>

<h2>Update History</h2>

<h3>July 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where SetupMinecraft.sh could throw an error if no Java version was installed</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 17th 2021</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fixed server name prompt</li>
    <li>Added username missing to fix service issue</li>
    <li>Reduced memory recommendation by 100MB to allow more space for the OS / other processes since newer versions of Minecraft are requiring more memory.  Remember, if you don't leave enough memory for other things the Minecraft server will crash for memory issues, but it's because you set it too high (counterintuitive I know) and didn't leave enough for the OS and it killed your Minecraft server to prevent the entire OS from crashing.</li>
    <li>Added in check to ensure start.sh and other scripts are not being ran as root.  If this happens you have to use sudo screen -r to find the screen and the permissions will be wrong since root isn't the owner of the server files</li>
    <li>If you know you ran the script/server as root (which starts creating files owned by root instead of the regular user) and your server won't start/is wonky run the fixpermissions script from your server folder with ./fixpermissions.sh and it will correct them for you!</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 15th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added safety check for path to server -- please use the default path of ~ if you aren't familiar with fully qualified Linux paths/directories -- you really don't want to change the safe defaults unless you have a really specific need.</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 14th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a issue that was causing backups to not rotate (it should only keep 10).  Thanks Olli</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 8th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.17.1</li>
<li>Update documentation to explain new AllowLocalCopy="1" flag.  This flag tells the script not to run the latest online version and to run the local copy.  You want to use this if you are changing the version or making any modifications to the script itself before running it.</li>
<li>Added update.sh convenience script that calls the latest version of SetupMinecraft.sh</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where having an OpenJDK greater than 16 was not triggering the snap configuration (usually only seen on the cutting edge Ubuntu flavors)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 5th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue with SetupMinecraft.sh saving scripts to the home folder instead of the minecraft folder (thanks Ryan A J.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>July 3rd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add option to choose a custom directory instead of forcing the home path</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 24th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removed installation of OpenJDK above OpenJDK 16 as the Paper Minecraft server is not working with versions higher than 16</li>
<li>If you have a higher version of Java installed use the following command: sudo update-alternatives â€“config java and select OpenJDK 16</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 19th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>1.17 Release</li>
<li>Make sure you have backups and take copies of your backups and place them outside the Minecraft folder to be 100% safe</li>
<li>Once running the new version you can't go back to the old one without restoring a backup because it writes new stuff in your server the old version doesn't understand and crashes on</li>
<li>As long as you have backups you should be okay!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raised minimum OpenJDK requirement to 16 in preparation for the 1.17 Paper Minecraft server release</li>
<li>If a new enough OpenJDK is not available in apt (Raspberry Pi OS is on OpenJDK 11 for example) it will be installed via snapd</li>
<li>If snapd is not installed it will ask you if you want to install it (reboot required) or abort</li>
<li>After the reboot run SetupMinecraft.sh again and it will finish installing OpenJDK 16!  Be patient, it can take some time, even 10-15 minutes on a good connection and longer on a bad one</li>
<li>Sorry for the inconvenience, there isn't an easier way to get it until the Raspberry Pi OS apt repositories are updated!</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 12th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed syntax error (thanks aruthir!)</li>
</ul>

<h3>June 10th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added OpenJDK 17 and 18 placeholders for prerequisite installations</li>
<li>Added a fallback to the non-headless JRE for platforms that don't offer that metapackage</li>
<li>Paper Minecraft 1.17 is not yet available but should be soon.  If you go to https://papermc.io/api/v1/paper/ and see 1.17 in the list it's available and you can change the version variable at the very top of SetupMinecraft.sh otherwise it hasn't been released yet.  Should be soon!</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 22nd 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lowered amount of recommended memory by a flat 200MB due to so many people having "Out of Memory" errors</li>
<li>Note:  Nobody has ever really been "out of memory" on the Pi since like the Pi 1.  The problem is you're using TOO MUCH.</li>
<li>If you're getting memory related crashes you need to turn your memory DOWN.  The server will recommend lower amounts going forward.</li>
</ul>

<h3>March 16th 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added backup rotation - server keeps the last 10 backups by default</li>
<li>If you want to change the amount of backups held it is located in the "start.sh" script with a comment of '# Rotate backups -- keep most recent 10'</li>
<li>This adds a little responsibility for saving really old backups but fixes the issue I and many others have had of the server getting filled with backups and crashing</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 31st 2021</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.5</li>
<li>Server now takes ownership of server files on each start to prevent folks a whole heap of trouble and heartache when restoring backups/moving files/etc.</li>
<li>Added check to make sure script isn't being ran as sudo to prevent installing to the /root folder</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 5th 2020</h3>
<ul>
<li>Update to 1.16.4</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if your username on the Pi was Minecraft it would cause the script to break (thanks Minecraftschurli, <a href="https://github.com/TheRemote/RaspberryPiMinecraft/pull/20">pull request #20</a>)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause OpenJDK 10 to try to be installed even if OpenJDK 11 installation was successful</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 28th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Backup system now takes a backup of your entire server folder (minus logs and cache) instead of just the world folders.  This mean it now backs up things like server.properties and other worlds if you are running a multiverse setup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>December 20th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated to version 1.15.1</li>
<li>Added more information to script installation warnings to help with initial configuration</li>
<li>Added warning to 2700MB limit on 32 bit operating systems explaining that you can lift the 3 GB limit by using a 64 bit Pi distribution</li>

</ul>

<h3>August 24th 2019</h3>
<ul>
<li>To prevent startup failure on 32bit ARM the maximum memory for the Minecraft server is capped at 2700MB. This is a per process limitation of 32 bit on ARM and Linux. This restriction can be lifted by using a 64 bit operating system.</li>
</ul>

<li>Current stable version of the Paper Minecraft server is 1.13.2</li>
<li>If you want to install 1.14.2 you may select to do so during installation</li>
<li>Be aware that 1.14.2 continues to have severe performance issues for the entire Minecraft server/hosting community.  After playing on it myself and talking to the Paper developers I can personally state that performance on 1.14.2 is really bad right now and highly recommend sticking with the stable version.</li>
</ul>

<h3>May 31st 2019</h3>
